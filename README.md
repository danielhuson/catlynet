CatlyNet is a program for working with autocatalytic networks. It is written in Java (12) and uses JavaFX.

It is loosely based on this webpage written by Dietrich Radel: http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/bio/RAF/

# Todo:

We intend to use this implementation
* as a means of delivering new algorithms for calculating or analyzing catalytic networks, and
* to provide different visualization and interactive exploration techniques for catayltic networks.
