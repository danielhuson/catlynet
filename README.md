CatlyNet is a program for working with autocatalytic networks. It is written in Java (12) and uses JavaFX. The program implements a fast and exact algorithm for calculating (maximal) RAFs, CAFs, and pseudo-RAFs from any set of catalysed 'reactions' and a given 'food' set.  These three notions are formalizations of the concept of a 'collectively autocatalytic set' originally introduced by Stuart Kauffman. 

It is loosely based on this web application written by Dietrich Radel: http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/bio/RAF/

# Todo:
We intend to use this implementation
* as a means of delivering new algorithms for calculating or analyzing catalytic networks, and
* to provide different reactionGraphView and interactive exploration techniques for catayltic networks.
