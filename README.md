CatlyNet is a program for working with autocatalytic networks. It is written in Java (12) and uses JavaFX. The program implements a fast and exact algorithm for calculating (maximal) RAFs, CAFs, and pseudo-RAFs from any set of catalysed 'reactions' and a given 'food' set.  These three notions are formalizations of the concept of a 'collectively autocatalytic set' originally introduced by Stuart Kauffman. 

CatlyNet is loosely based on a web application written by Dietrich Radel: http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/bio/RAF/

## Early release
This program is at a very early stage of development. The program has not been throughly tested and will definitely contain many bugs. Any or all of the features of the code base and program may change without notice. Use at your own risk. Please report any bugs or feature requests to the authors.

## Todo
We intend to
* use this program as a means of delivering new algorithms for calculating or analyzing catalytic networks,
* implement support for "inhibitors" and associated algorithms, and
* provide different visualization and interactive exploration techniques for catayltic networks.

## Installers
One click installers for MacOS, Windows and Linux are available [here](http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/data/software/catlynet/download/welcome.html). 

## Animation
We are working on animations to visualize different concepts, see this example:
